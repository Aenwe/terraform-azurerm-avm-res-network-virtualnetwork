# Azure Verified Module for Azure Virtual Networks

This code sample shows how to create and manage Azure Virtual Networks (vNets) and associate route tables.

```hcl
#Importing the Azure naming module to ensure resources have unique CAF compliant names.
module "naming" {
  source  = "Azure/naming/azurerm"
  version = "0.3.0"
}

resource "random_id" "rg_name" {
  byte_length = 8
}

#Creating a resource group with a unique name in the specified location.
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  location = var.rg_location
  name     = module.naming.resource_group.name_unique
}
locals {
  subnets = {
    for i in range(3) :
    "subnet${i}" => {
      address_prefixes = [cidrsubnet(local.virtual_network_address_space, 8, i)]
      route_table = {
        id = azurerm_route_table.example.id
      }
    }
  }
  virtual_network_address_space = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

module "vnet" {
  source                        = "../../"
  resource_group_name           = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_address_space = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  subnets                       = local.subnets
  location                      = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  name                          = "azure-subnets-vnet"

}

resource "azurerm_route_table" "example" {
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  name                = "MyRouteTable"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_route" "example" {
  address_prefix      = local.virtual_network_address_space
  name                = "acceptanceTestRoute1"
  next_hop_type       = "VnetLocal"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  route_table_name    = azurerm_route_table.example.name
}
```
